Hours,float,10.4,"Expected time duration for a job, how long the work is predicted to take.","Used to analyze how much time is being allocated to various types of work, to various locations where the business operates, and for other categorical and more specific information and analyses.

The more direct use outside of analytics and for more operational work, hours can be used to make schedule planning decisions, and to optimize a schedule. Hours are an important piece of data for the actual planning of work orders, in addition to analyses that happen during the use of this operations planning dashboard.",Data lake,Work order system
